### Shadowing Pre-med

`2018-2019`
__Scott & White NICU__, Temple, Texas

-Although no longer my major, I had many great experiences with doctors in the field of medicine. During my time shadowing in a NICU, I saw the dedication and expertise of the healthcare professionals as they cared for the tiniest and most vulnerable patients. Witnessing medical technology and compassionate human touch left a lasting impression on me. It reinforced my desire to pursue a career where I can contribute to the well-being of others in need.

`2015-2019`
__Robotics__, Salado, Texas

-Being on my high school robotics team was an unforgettable experience, full of highs and lows. We faced numerous challenges, from programming setbacks to mechanical failures/breaks, but we perservered anyways. Through countless hours of hard work and collaboration, we overcame these obstacles, and our success culminated in qualifying for the World Championship in Houston.

## Service and Work History

`2019`
__Eagle Scout__

-Becoming an Eagle Scout was an incredibly rewarding journey that gave me some great experiences and new friends. From planning and executing community projects to the personal growth, the experience shaped me into a responsible and compassionate individual which helped me have a positive impact on my community and had prepared me to face future challenges with confidence.

`2019-2020`
__Caretaker__

-Being a caretaker for a half-paralyzed man taught me invaluable life lessons. The experience instilled in me patience and kindness, showing me the power of empathy and understanding. Through our friendship, I learned that the simplest acts of compassion can make a profound difference in someone's life.

`2020-2022`
__Missionary__, San Jose, California
-Being a Spanish-speaking LDS missionary in the Bay Area, I was truly inspired by the hard work and humility of the people I encountered. From early morning until night, I witnessed their dedication to family, community, and God. Despite facing challenges, they remained dedicated to the mission of Christ, teaching me valuable lessons about how I should act and who I can become with effort

`2022-Now`
__Package Handler__, Rigby, Idaho
-Two weeks after getting back from mission service, I joined Fedex in a local warehouse loading trucks with packages. I had to adapt to the 4am mornings and heavy days while having a full day after, it taught me hard work and perserverance. I would also be one of handlers who management asked to cover new areas when someone didn't show up or to help anyone who looked overwelmed. I had to have good communication and foresight to keep up with the challenges faced each day.
